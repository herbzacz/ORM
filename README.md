## ORM in Python

Object-relational mapping (ORM) in Python with the package "sqlalchemy"

**WHY?**

Programming languages like Python storage data in objects. On the other side relational databases put data in a specific schema to retrieve information with DML-Queries.

Example: You have a written program in Python, which collects data from a GUI. This data can be transferred to a database with an ORM Mapper.

**Source Code Example:**  
Input: CSV-files with corporate sales data  
Output: SQL Server Database with entries out of the CSV-files
